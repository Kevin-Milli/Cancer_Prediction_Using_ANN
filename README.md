# Breast Cancer Prediction
### Kevin Milli

## Objectives and Goal
The primary objective of this project is to conduct data research using the Kaggle dataset known as the Breast Cancer Dataset. The dataset focuses on breast cancer, the most prevalent cancer among women globally. With a goal to contribute to cancer detection, this project aims to address the challenge of classifying tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using Deep Learning techniques.

## Dataset Description
Breast cancer accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, affecting over 2.1 million people in 2015 alone. The dataset provides various features related to tumor characteristics, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension. The key challenge lies in accurately classifying tumors based on these features.

## Setup
To execute this project, the following Python libraries are required:

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow
* Keras
